# Camera Calibration and Player Localization in SoccerNet-v2

## Key Contribution

Distills a commercial [[camera-calibration]] tool (EVS Xeebra) into a neural network (CCBV-SN) on 12,000 frames from SoccerNet's 500 games — the largest public soccer calibration dataset. Releases calibration estimates, player localisations, and the trained network. Proposes three calibration data representations and achieves SOTA on SoccerNet-v2 action spotting (Average-mAP **46.8%**).

## Calibration (CCBV-SN)

Based on the [[sports-camera-calibration-synthetic-data|CCBV architecture (Chen & Little, 2019)]]: dictionary of synthetic field templates → zone segmentation (U-Net) → [[siamese-network]] for rough [[homography]] lookup → Spatial Transform Network for refinement. Student trained on 12K pseudo-ground-truth calibrations from the commercial teacher. Achieves 88.5% IoU (part) on World Cup 2014 without any fine-tuning on that dataset.

## Three Representations of Calibrated Data

1. **Top view images:** Color composition (CC) or binary channels (BC) showing field lines, camera polygon, and player squares.
2. **Feature vectors:** Top views compressed via frozen ResNet-34 or EfficientNet-B4.
3. **Player graph:** Nodes = players (RGB colour, world position, bbox area); edges between players within 25m. Processed by DeeperGCN (14 blocks).

## Action Spotting Integration

Split 17 SoccerNet-v2 classes into "patterned" (8 classes: penalty, kick-off, corner, throw-in, free-kick, cards) and "fuzzy" (9 classes: goal, substitution, offside, shots, etc.). Calibration features concatenated with ResNet features only for patterned classes within the CALF architecture. Best: CC + ResNet-34 + FCL → 46.8% Average-mAP, outperforming CALF alone (40.7%).
