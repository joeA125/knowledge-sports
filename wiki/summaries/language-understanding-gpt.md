# Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training (GPT)

**Authors:** [[alec-radford]], Karthik Narasimhan, Tim Salimans, [[ilya-sutskever]]
**Affiliation:** [[openai]]
**Published:** 2018

## Key Contribution

Introduces the [[pre-train-then-fine-tune]] paradigm for [[transformer]]-based language understanding: a 12-layer decoder-only Transformer is pre-trained as a left-to-right language model on BooksCorpus (800M words), then fine-tuned with minimal architectural changes on downstream tasks. SOTA on 9 of 12 benchmarks, demonstrating that generative pre-training transfers to *discriminative* tasks.

## Architecture

A 12-layer decoder-only [[transformer]] with masked [[multi-head-attention]] (768-d states, 12 heads, 3072-d FFN). Learned [[positional-encoding|position embeddings]] rather than sinusoidal, BPE [[tokenization|tokenisation]] (40K merges), GELU, [[layer-normalization]]. 117M parameters.

Pre-training objective: standard left-to-right language modelling, $L_1(\mathcal{U}) = \sum_i \log P(u_i \mid u_{i-k}, \ldots, u_{i-1})$ — see [[autoregressive-model]].

## Task-Specific Input Transformations

Rather than task-specific architectures, GPT converts every task into a token sequence with delimiters:

- **Classification:** `[Start] Text [Extract]`
- **Entailment:** `[Start] Premise [Delim] Hypothesis [Extract]`
- **Similarity:** both orderings processed, representations added element-wise
- **Multiple choice:** each answer concatenated with context separately

Only one new linear output layer per task. An auxiliary LM loss ($\lambda = 0.5$) during fine-tuning improves generalisation and convergence.

**The framing move is the durable part**: reshaping the *input* rather than the *model* so one architecture serves many tasks. The same manoeuvre appears in [[large-event-model|football-as-language]] work, where matches become token sequences — see [[tokenization]] for the representational cost when the underlying data is structured tuples rather than words.

## Key Results

| Task | GPT | Previous SOTA | Improvement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Story Cloze (commonsense) | **86.5%** | 77.6% | +8.9% |
| RACE (QA) | **59.0%** | 53.3% | +5.7% |
| MultiNLI (entailment) | **82.1%** | 80.6% | +1.5% |
| GLUE (overall) | **72.8** | 68.9 | +3.9 |

## Key Ablation Findings

- **Pre-training is essential** — without it, average performance drops 14.8%.
- **Transformer beats LSTM** — swapping in a single-layer 2048-unit [[lstm]] costs 5.6 points, which the authors attribute to the Transformer's structured memory aiding transfer.
- **The auxiliary LM objective helps on large datasets** (NLI, QQP) and not on smaller ones — a sample-size-dependent result of the same shape as [[gradient-boosting|the vault's tree-ensemble finding]]: an addition that regularises at scale can overfit below it.
- **Layer transfer is monotone** — each additional Transformer layer transferred improves performance, up to all 12.

## Zero-Shot Behaviour

Zero-shot performance on sentiment, Winograd schemas, linguistic acceptability and QA improves steadily *as pre-training progresses*, without any supervised fine-tuning — evidence that the LM acquires task-relevant capability as a by-product of language modelling. See [[zero-shot-learning]].

This is the same structural observation the vault records for [[event-prediction]]: **a model trained to forecast produces evaluative capability as a by-product**, needing no task labels. Two literatures, one pattern.

## Impact

GPT established that left-to-right Transformer LMs pre-trained on large corpora transfer to diverse NLP tasks with minimal architectural change. The [[pre-train-then-fine-tune]] paradigm became the foundation for GPT-2 and GPT-3, was refined by [[bert-bidirectional-transformers|BERT]] (bidirectional pre-training via [[masked-language-model]]), and later extended by [[training-lm-follow-instructions-with-human-feedback|InstructGPT]] and [[rlhf|RLHF]]. Its scaling behaviour is the subject of [[scaling-neural-language-models|Kaplan et al.]]
