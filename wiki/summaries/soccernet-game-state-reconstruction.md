## Key Contribution

Introduces [[game-state-reconstruction]] (GSR), a novel computer vision task for football analytics that combines tracking, identification (role, team, jersey number), and pitch localisation into a unified benchmark. Releases SoccerNet-GSR (200 annotated 30-second clips, 9.37M line points, 2.36M athlete annotations), the GS-HOTA evaluation metric, and an open-source baseline pipeline.

## Task Definition

Given a broadcast video, predict for each frame and each athlete: pitch coordinates ($x$, $y$), role (player/goalkeeper/referee/other), team (left/right), and jersey number. Output is a minimap visualisation of the game state.

## GS-HOTA Metric

Extends HOTA with: (1) LocSim — Gaussian kernel on Euclidean pitch distance ($\tau = 5$m tolerance); (2) IdSim — binary match requiring all attributes correct. This strict constraint means a single wrong attribute turns a detection into a false positive.

## Baseline Pipeline (GSR-Baseline)

YOLOv8 detection → StrongSORT tracking → PRTreID for role/team-aware embeddings → [[tvcalib-camera-calibration-football|TVCalib]] for pitch localisation and [[camera-calibration]] → MMOCR for jersey number recognition → majority voting for tracklet consistency → K-means for team affiliation.

The pipeline relies on [[homography]] estimation to map image-space detections to pitch coordinates, making camera calibration the critical link between detection and localisation.

## Results

Full GS-HOTA on test: **22.26%**. Jersey number recognition is the biggest bottleneck (drops score from 42.65% to 25.65% when enabled). Camera calibration failures cause catastrophic localisation errors.
