# Multi-Object Tracking

Following several objects across video frames while maintaining **consistent identities**. Detection asks *what is in this frame*; tracking asks *which of these is the same thing as before*.

## Tracking-by-Detection

1. **Detect** objects independently in each frame — see [[object-detection]].
2. **Associate** detections across frames into tracks.

Association combines motion prediction (a Kalman filter, giving where each track should appear next) with appearance matching via learned embeddings — see [[siamese-network]]. Assignment is usually solved per frame by the Hungarian algorithm.

The two cues are complementary: motion is reliable over short gaps and useless after an occlusion; appearance survives occlusion and fails when objects look alike.

## Why Football Is Hard

- **Uniform appearance.** Teammates wear identical kits, so the appearance cue — the one that ought to survive occlusion — is nearly useless *within* a team. No equivalent in pedestrian tracking.
- **Frequent occlusion.** Players cluster at set pieces and in duels, precisely when tracking matters most.
- **Erratic motion.** Sprints and contact break constant-velocity assumptions.
- **Moving camera.** Broadcast footage pans and zooms; disentangling image from object motion needs [[camera-calibration]] or [[image-alignment|frame registration]].
- **Small, low-resolution targets** in wide shots.

The consequence is **identity switches** — a switch does not merely lose a player, it corrupts both trajectories.

## Where It Sits in the Pipeline

$$\text{video} \to \text{detection} \to \text{tracking} \to \text{[[camera-calibration]]} \to \text{[[optical-tracking-data]]}$$

[[game-state-reconstruction]] is the end-to-end version. [[pitch-control]], [[obso|OBSO]], [[c-obso]], [[soccermap]] and every tracking-based valuation framework take player positions as *given*. They are not given; they are a tracker's output.

> **Weakened, 2026-07-27.** [[generalized-vdep-euro-location-analysis|Umemoto, Tsutsui & Fujii (2022)]] do not propagate *uncertainty*, but they do measure the cost of **incomplete observation** — sweeping the number of visible players from 0 to 11 and reporting F1 at each. That is the closest thing the vault holds to input-quality sensitivity analysis, and it partially answers the question this claim was raised to pose.

Their result is directly relevant: **ball-gain prediction saturates at three or four players; scores, concedes and being-attacked need none beyond the ball.** So for three of four targets, missing players cost nothing measurable — which bounds how much tracking completeness can matter for those predictions.

It does not address **positional error or identity switches**, which are different failure modes from missing observations. A player tracked to the wrong coordinates is worse than a player absent, because the model has no signal that anything is amiss. Structured error also concentrates under occlusion, so it is worst exactly where value concentrates. See [[tracking-error-propagation]].

## Evaluation

- **MOTA** — combines false positives, misses and identity switches; dominated by detection quality.
- **IDF1** — identity-aware F1 over the whole track, so it penalises switches properly.
- **HOTA** — explicitly balances detection and association.

> ^[generated: an absence claim about what is *published*, not about what exists. rests-on: absence:no-provider-metrics-in-held-sources — ⚠️ expires if a paper reports its provider's error rates. Weaker than it reads: the vault holds a handful of papers using [[stats-perform]] and [[data-stadium]] data, not a survey of provider documentation.]

Note that a **sensitivity curve does not require knowing the true error rate** — perturb clean data across a range, and a provider's actual rate need only be located on the curve. GVDEP's n_nearest sweep is a partial instance of exactly that method, applied to completeness rather than accuracy.
