# Camera Calibration (Sports Broadcast)

Camera calibration in sports broadcast refers to estimating the camera's intrinsic parameters (focal length / field of view) and extrinsic parameters (position and orientation: pan, tilt, roll, translation) from a single broadcast frame, using the sports field's known geometry as a calibration object.

## Field Registration ≠ Camera Calibration

The [[camera-calibration-benchmarking|ProCC paper (Magera et al., 2025)]] draws a critical distinction:

- **Sports field registration** estimates a [[homography]] mapping the 2D field plane to the image. This is insufficient for 3D applications — goal posts, airborne balls, and player heights are out of scope.
- **Camera calibration** estimates full camera parameters providing a mapping between the 3D world (not just the field plane) and the image.

Most existing benchmarks (WC14, CARWC) annotate homographies as ground truth, which forces and rewards field registration methods even when papers claim to do camera calibration. The [[jac-metric|JaC metric]] addresses this by evaluating camera calibration model-agnostically.

## Why It Matters

Camera calibration is the critical bridge between image-space detections and real-world pitch coordinates. In [[game-state-reconstruction]], calibration failures cause catastrophic localisation errors — a single bad frame can place players 50+ metres from their true position. Calibration also enables offside detection, virtual stadium graphics, augmented reality overlays, and automated camera control.

## Radial Distortion

[[radial-distortion|Radial distortion]] from broadcast camera lenses is a significant source of error that [[homography]]-based methods cannot model. The ProCC paper shows that pinhole + one radial distortion coefficient achieves JaC₅ **92.5** vs **79.1** for the best homography annotations on WC14, with disagreement exceeding **2.5 metres** in some pitch regions — failing FIFA's 50cm standard for offside technology.

## Three Approaches

### 1. Synthetic Retrieval + Refinement
[[sports-camera-calibration-synthetic-data|Chen & Little (2019)]] exploit the strong prior of sports camera placement — cameras are roughly fixed on the main tribune with only three significant free parameters ($f$, $\phi$, $\theta$) — to generate large synthetic databases of edge images with known camera poses. A [[siamese-network]] learns compact 16-d features for nearest-neighbour retrieval, and Lucas-Kanade alignment refines the result. Achieves 94.5% mean IoU$_{part}$ on WC14.

[[soccernet-v2-action-spotting|CCBV-SN]] (Cioppa et al., 2021) extends this with distilled commercial knowledge: zone segmentation → Siamese retrieval → STN refinement, achieving 88.5% IoU$_{part}$ on WC14.

### 2. Homography Estimation
Traditional approaches predict a $3 \times 3$ [[homography]] matrix mapping the 2D field plane to the image via keypoint detection + DLT or direct regression.

**Limitation:** Cannot model 3D elements or [[radial-distortion]]. Homography decomposition to recover camera parameters introduces additional errors.

### 3. Direct Camera Parameter Optimisation
[[tvcalib-camera-calibration-football|TVCalib]] (Theiner & Ewerth, 2023): differentiable segment reprojection loss optimises camera parameters via gradient descent. No training data needed for the calibration module. Outperforms Chen & Little (CS 86.4 vs 79.0 on WC14).

The [[soccernet-game-state-reconstruction-improvement|Constructor Tech pipeline]] (Golovkin et al., 2024): SegFormer regression predicting 7 camera params + keypoint refinement, achieving real-time 80 FPS.

## Evaluation

The [[jac-metric|JaC metric (ProCC)]] replaces IoU-based evaluation with a model-agnostic Jaccard index over reprojected field elements, enabling fair comparison across homography, pinhole, and distortion-aware methods.

## Key Challenges

1. **Limited visible field markings:** In close-up or corner views, too few lines/circles are visible.
2. **Segment localisation quality:** TVCalib shows 4–7% compound score drop between GT and predicted segmentation.
3. **Non-main cameras:** Most methods tuned for central broadcast; other camera types remain harder.
4. **Temporal consistency:** Single-frame calibration can jitter; temporal smoothing helps.
5. **[[radial-distortion|Lens distortion]]:** Necessary for professional accuracy but can cause local minima during optimisation.
