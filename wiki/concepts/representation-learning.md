# Representation Learning

Learning what to *feed* a model rather than hand-specifying it. The premise is that most of a model's performance is determined by how its inputs are encoded, and that encoding can itself be learned.

## The Vault's Sharpest Disagreement

Three football sources give apparently contradictory results on handcrafted features.

| Source | Finding |
|---|---|
| [[seq2event]] | **Degrades without** handcrafted geometric features |
| [[sig-model]] | **Degrades with** them |
| [[xsot\|Yeung & Fujii]] | A [[theory-based-modelling\|theory-based feature]] is essential (CEL 0.4876 vs 0.5545); **raw player coordinates are actively harmful** (0.5684, worse than omitting them) |

## The Proposed Reconciliation

> ^[generated: a reconciliation constructed in this vault. No source states it, none of the three addresses the others, and it has never been tested against a case it was not built to fit. Also referenced by [[theory-based-modelling]] and the synthesis. rests-on: source:seq2event-ablation, source:sigmodel-ablation, source:yeung-fujii-ablation]

A [[path-signature]] recovers path geometry by construction, so adding it is redundant. A small MLP on 2,575 examples cannot recover occlusion geometry, so adding it is informative. The disagreement is about which regime you are in.

**What is wrong with it as stated.** The two clauses are not independent. "The representation cannot recover it" is a property of the *architecture*; "the data cannot support learning" is a property of *where on its learning curve* a flexible model sits. That gives a 2×2:

| | Representation **can** recover | Representation **cannot** |
|---|---|---|
| **Enough data** | Redundant → harmful ([[sig-model]]) | Helpful ([[seq2event]]?) |
| **Not enough data** | **Untested** | Essential ([[xsot\|Yeung & Fujii]]) |

One cell is empty and Seq2Event's placement is uncertain — nobody has shown a transformer over zone tokens *cannot* recover the geometry, only that it performed worse without the features at that sample size. So the rule is supported by **one clean case per clause and no case testing them jointly**.

**What would falsify it.** It predicts a locatable crossover: for a fixed architecture and engineered feature, the feature helps at small $N$ and stops helping as $N$ grows. If curve (b) never approaches curve (a) at any reachable $N$, the first clause is doing all the work and the second is decorative. A data-scaling sweep on Yeung & Fujii's public code would settle it. See [[handcrafted-features-rule]].

**Treat it as a working heuristic, not a finding.**

## Three Routes

| Route | Mechanism | Example here |
|---|---|---|
| **Mathematical** | A principled transform with known properties | [[path-signature]], matrix factorisation |
| **Architectural** | Structure that makes the right thing expressible | [[graph-neural-network\|GNN]] permutation equivariance, [[fully-convolutional-network\|FCN]] weight sharing |
| **Learned end-to-end** | Train on a proxy task, keep the internals | [[player-embedding]], pre-training then fine-tuning |

The first two are underrated. [[sig-model]] beats a transformer benchmark with a plain feedforward network on signature features, and [[soccermap]]'s weight sharing is what makes [[single-pixel-supervision|learning a surface from one pixel]] possible at all. Neither is a matter of scale.

## Removing Shortcuts Improves Representations

[[scoutgpt]] **masks position tokens during training**, forcing the model to infer role from player identity plus surrounding events. The learned [[player-embedding|embeddings]] separate by position anyway, with tactically coherent geometry, and cross-season same-player retrieval *improves* (Top-1 9.20% vs 8.48%).

Removing the easy signal produced a better representation — the same logic as masked language modelling, and behind [[variational-autoencoder|VLAE]] restricting its decoder's receptive field to force global structure into the latent.

The general form: **a representation learns what it is not given for free.**^[generated: the generalisation across these three cases is drawn here; each source states only its own version. rests-on: source:scoutgpt-masking, source:vlae-receptive-field]

## What Counts as Good

Rarely defined explicitly, and the candidates conflict:

- **Downstream task performance** — the default, and circular if you only have one task.
- **Transfer** — does it help elsewhere? The [[large-event-model|foundation-model]] ambition.
- **Structure** — does the geometry mean something? Position separation in ScoutGPT.
- **Compression** — how much can be discarded? [[variational-autoencoder|VLAE]]'s framing.

[[interpretability]] is a fifth and often traded against the rest — though [[nmstpp]]'s *Juego de posición* zoning is a rare case where it came free, performing identically to raw coordinates while producing outputs in coaching vocabulary.
