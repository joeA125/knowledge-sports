# Predictive Validity

Predictive validity asks whether a metric forecasts future outcomes it ought to forecast. It is one of the few available answers to a hard problem: **how do you validate a metric when there is no ground truth?**

## The Problem It Solves

Football possession-value metrics have no correct answer to compare against. When [[expected-threat|xT]] and [[vaep]] disagree about a through ball, nothing adjudicates — [[on-ball-actions-football-xt-vs-vaep|Van Roy et al.]] state plainly that determining true action values is "very difficult, if not impossible."

Four strategies have emerged in this vault, answering different questions:

| Strategy | Question | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Concurrent correlation** | Does it agree with known-good indicators *now*? | [[hpus]] vs same-season xG (0.92) |
| **[[split-half-reliability\|Reliability]]** | Is the measurement *stable*? | xT ρ=0.89 vs VAEP ρ=0.25 |
| **Predictive validity** | Does it forecast *future* outcomes? | See below |
| **External criterion** | Does it track something outside the pipeline? | [[c-obso]] vs salary (0.45) |

None is sufficient alone. Concurrent correlation risks rewarding redundancy. Reliability can be high for something measuring the wrong thing.

## The Strongest Result: Player-Level, External Outcome

[[beyond-expected-goals|Spearman (2018)]] correlates each player's match-$i$ value against their match-$(i{+}1)$ output across 53 matches:

| Predictor ↓ / Outcome → | Next-match OBSO | Next-match shots | **Next-match goals** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **[[obso\|OBSO]]** | 0.60 | 0.37 | **0.26** |
| Shots | ~ | 0.35 | 0.17 |
| Goals | ~ | ~ | 0.12 |

**A player's off-ball positioning predicts his next-match goals better than his shots or his goals do.**

This is the vault's best predictive-validity evidence, and it clears three bars the other results do not:

- **Player-level**, not team-level.
- **Against an independent outcome** (goals), not the metric's own future value.
- **Beating the outcome's own lagged value** — the strongest available form, since it shows the metric carries signal the outcome itself does not.

Spearman states this as the design objective outright: build **a leading indicator less stochastic than scoring itself.**

## The Team-Level Result

[[understanding-football-possessions-path-signatures|Hirnschall & Bajons (2025)]], following Spearman (2018) and Davis et al. (2024), correlate each metric in one match against outcomes in a team's *subsequent* match:

| | poss-util | [[hpus\|HPUS]] | [[lpv\|LPV]] | xG | goals |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| vs next-match xG | 0.15 | 0.27 | **0.32** | 0.21 | 0.19 |
| vs next-match goals | 0.17 | 0.26 | **0.28** | 0.17 | 0.11 |

Same shape as Spearman's, one level up: **HPUS and LPV both beat xG and goals at predicting the next match** — including at predicting goals themselves.

**Goals are the worst predictor of future goals** in both tables ($\rho = 0.11$ and $0.12$, arrived at independently seven years apart). This is regression to the mean in its sports form: a scoreline is a small, noisy sample of an underlying process, while a possession-value metric aggregates hundreds of actions and estimates that process directly. **Measuring the process beats measuring the outcome when the outcome is sparse.**

## The Weaker Player-Level Result

[[epv-control-duel-skills-football|Shelopugin]] predicts a player's next-season [[pass-carry-reward|PCR]] against a persistence baseline:

| Sample | Baseline RMSE | Model RMSE |
|---|---|---|
| All data (>100 min) | 0.053 | **0.033** |
| Same team, same league | 0.050 | **0.032** |
| New team, new league | 0.061 | **0.037** |

Useful for what it shows about *movement*: persistence degrades monotonically as a player changes club and league, while the model's advantage holds — exactly the population [[recruitment]] cares about.

But it predicts **the metric's own future value**, not an independent outcome:

| | Predicts | Rules out |
|---|---|---|
| Spearman, Hirnschall & Bajons | An external outcome | A metric that stably measures the wrong thing |
| Shelopugin (PCR) | Itself, one season later | Only pure noise |

Self-prediction establishes that a metric captures something **persistent**; it does not establish that the persistent thing is skill. A metric tracking tactical role rather than quality would score just as well.

## Cross-Horizon Consistency

[[vdep]] adds a check nobody else reports, and it is nearly free. Its match-level and season-level correlations are similar (0.464, 0.397) while VAEP's diverge sharply (0.830 → 0.177).

A metric that tracks the match it measures but not the season is **reproducing the scoreline**; one whose correlations hold across horizons is measuring a team property. Worth adopting as standard.

## Why This Is the Right Test Here

Predictive validity suits situations where the quantity of interest is a persistent latent property observed only through noisy realisations.

It is also resistant to a failure mode that catches concurrent correlation. A metric that simply recomputed goals would score perfectly on same-match correlation with goals and poorly on predicting future goals, inheriting all the noise. Requiring forecast performance forces the metric to capture signal rather than echo the outcome.

## Relation to Reliability

Complementary, and they can disagree. A metric could be highly reliable yet forecast nothing, if it stably measures an irrelevant property. Conversely a noisy metric cannot forecast well, since its noise propagates — so **reliability is necessary but not sufficient for predictive validity.**

The vault's evidence is consistent: xT is the most reliable (ρ = 0.89), while OBSO, HPUS and LPV are the most predictive. No single source reports both for the same metric — a gap in the literature rather than in these notes, and PCR is the sharpest instance, with its forecastability documented in detail and its reliability unreported.

## Origin

The term comes from psychometrics, where predictive validity means a test forecasts a criterion outcome — an aptitude test predicting job performance. It sits alongside [[construct-validity]] (does it measure the intended concept?) and content validity (does it cover the domain?).

The PCR case illustrates why that tradition keeps them separate: demonstrating that a test score predicts *next year's test score* is a reliability finding dressed as a validity one.
