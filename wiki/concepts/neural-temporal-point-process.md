# Neural Temporal Point Process (NTPP)

An NTPP (reviewed by Shchur, Türkmen, Januschowski & Günnemann, 2021) combines the [[point-process]] formalism with neural networks: rather than specifying a parametric intensity function, it learns the conditional distributions of event timing and marks from data.

## The Three-Step Construction

The framework prescribes a uniform recipe:

**1. Represent each event as a feature vector.**
Embed categorical attributes (event type, location class), concatenate with continuous features (inter-event time, engineered geometry), giving $\vec{y}_i = [t_i, m_i, z_i, \dots]$.

**2. Encode the history into a fixed-size vector.**
The whole preceding sequence $(\vec{y}_1, \dots, \vec{y}_{i-1})$ is compressed into a single $\vec{h}_i$. Standard choices: an RNN, [[gated-recurrent-unit|GRU]], [[lstm|LSTM]], or a [[transformer]] encoder.

**3. Predict the next event from $\vec{h}_i$.**
Any of several parameterisations: probability density, CDF, survival function, hazard function, or cumulative hazard — or, as [[nmstpp]] does, predict the value directly and train on a regression loss.

The hazard and survival parameterisations are the same objects [[survival-analysis]] is built on; a point process's conditional intensity *is* a hazard conditioned on history. The two literatures describe one thing in different notation.

## Why the History Encoding Step Matters

Feeding raw event sequences into a model is both ineffective (noise) and inefficient (parameter blow-up). Compressing history to a fixed-size vector is the same manoeuvre as the [[encoder-decoder-bottleneck|seq2seq bottleneck]] — and inherits the same tension, since a fixed vector must summarise an arbitrarily long history.

This is precisely where the [[attention-mechanism]] earns its place. Self-attention lets the model weight historical events by relevance rather than compressing them uniformly. In [[transformer-point-process-football-event-modelling|Yeung et al.]], attention weights over a 40-event football history sit between 0.01 and 0.06 with no systematic trend, which the authors read as evidence the window length is appropriate.

[[sig-model|Sig-Model]] rejects the fixed-window premise entirely, encoding the whole possession as a [[path-signature]] instead — a different answer to the same bottleneck problem. See [[event-prediction]].

## Transformer vs Recurrent Encoders

The empirical picture from the football experiments:

| Encoder | Total loss | Training time |
|---|---|---|
| Uni-LSTM | 4.51 | 129 min |
| Transformer | 4.57 | 47 min |

The LSTM is marginally more accurate; the transformer is **2.7× faster to train**. This matches the general finding in the NTPP literature and in [[seq2event]] — recurrent encoders remain competitive on accuracy, but their sequential gradient computation makes them expensive on long sequences, exactly the tradeoff that motivated the [[transformer]] in the first place. See [[lstm]].

## Why Learned Distributions Beat Parametric Ones

Classical point processes require committing to a functional form — exponential decay for Hawkes, gamma for waiting times. NTPPs make no such commitment.

The evidence in the football case is direct: NMSTPP's predicted inter-event-time CDF matches the empirical CDF closely, **despite the model never assuming a distribution for $t$** — it simply regresses the value and lets the loss shape the implied distribution.

## Applications

Originally developed for general event-sequence domains — Du et al. (2016) on recurrent marked temporal point processes, Zuo et al. (2020) and Zhang et al. (2020) on transformer and self-attentive Hawkes processes. Sports event modelling is a comparatively recent application, with [[nmstpp]] the first to bring the framework to football.
