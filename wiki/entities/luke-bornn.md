# Luke Bornn

Statistician working across basketball and football spatial analytics. Simon Fraser University and the Sacramento Kings at the time of the 2018 paper; Assistant Professor at Simon Fraser at the time of the 2016 one.

**Three held sources**, and the connective figure in the vault's possession-value literature.

| Year | Work | With | Contribution |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2016 | [[multiresolution-stochastic-process-nba-possessions\|Multiresolution EPV]] | Cervone, D'Amour, Goldsberry | [[martingale-epv]] |
| 2018 | [[wide-open-spaces-space-creation\|Wide Open Spaces]] | [[javier-fernandez\|Fernández]] | [[pitch-control]] (Gaussian), [[pitch-value-model]], [[space-occupation-gain\|SOG/SGG]] |
| 2020/21 | [[expected-value-possession-framework\|Soccer EPV framework]] | Fernández, Cervone | Decomposed tracking-based EPV, [[soccermap]] |

## The Through-Line

**Turn positional tracking into a spatial field, then reason over the field rather than over events.** In basketball that yields spatial bases and defender-assignment models; in football, control surfaces, value surfaces, and eventually full-pitch [[probability-surface|value surfaces]].

Also co-author on the defensive-structure work (Franks et al., 2015) underlying the EPV microtransition model, and the factorised point-process work (Miller et al., 2013) informing its NMF spatial bases.

## What Wide Open Spaces Established

> **Updated, 2026-07-27.** This page previously described the 2018 paper as unheld and as "the vault's other route into space-creation". It is now held, and it did more than one thing.

Three models composing into one quantity: a **Gaussian influence [[pitch-control|pitch-control]] model**, a **[[pitch-value-model|ball-relative pitch value model]]** learned from where defenders stand, and the **[[space-occupation-gain|SOG/SGG]]** metrics built on their product.

Two of the three have outlived the third. The pitch-control model became the substrate for the [[expected-value-possession-framework|2020 EPV framework]] and is one of the vault's two control traditions; the pitch-value model is the only value surface here trained without outcome labels. SOG and SGG have not been extended by anyone.

## The Two Pitch-Control Traditions

Bornn's construction is one of two the vault holds, and the pairing is instructive:

| | Bornn & Fernández | [[william-spearman\|Spearman]] |
|---|---|---|
| Origin | Spatial dominance | A **pass-reception** model |
| Mechanism | Gaussian influence density | Arrival-time contest, Poisson control |
| Parameters | **Expert-set** | **MLE-fitted, with stated errors** |
| Validated against | Expert video review | **5,471 held-out pass receivers** |

Neither cites the other; both position against [[voronoi-tessellation]]. See [[pitch-control-traditions-compared]].

## The Basketball-to-Football Trade

Bornn is on both sides of a methodological reversal the vault records in detail. [[martingale-epv|The 2016 basketball model]] is a Bayesian [[stochastic-process|stochastic process]] with a [[martingale]] guarantee, costing 461 processors. [[expected-value-possession-framework|The 2020 soccer framework]] abandons that guarantee for nine supervised components, gaining real-time inference and off-ball coverage.

His presence on both makes that **a considered change of approach rather than an oversight by newcomers.** See [[martingale-epv]] for the trade.

Funded at the time by DARPA, the US Army Research Office, Amazon AWS, and NSERC.
